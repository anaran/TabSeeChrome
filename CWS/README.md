These are developer instructions, users don't need to know about this.

[TabSee - Overview](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabsee/fdbmibopighjnhplajkbkkhmgekkmffb) is all there is to know to use this extension.

[icon]: ../TabSee/tabsee128x128.png "../TabSee/tabsee128x128.png"

Screenshots
----
These are created using canary chrome sized at 640x400.

I usually use the Gimp for transparency, scaling, then export from it to png format.

`Inspect element` is useful to display the size while adjusting the chrome window.

Use e.g. the `Capture Visible Tab` feature of Chrome extension `Autosave Text` to create a PNG image of the page and save it with `Ctrl`+`S`.

The screenshots are all [here](.).
